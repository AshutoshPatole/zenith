Specialized containers that run before app containers in a Pod are called Init containers.These  containers can contain utilities or setup scripts not present in an app image.

### Understanding init containers
A Pod can have multiple containers running apps within it, but it can also have one or more init containers, which are run before the app containers are started.

- Init containers are exactly like regular containers, except:
- Init containers always run to completion.

Each init container must complete successfully before the next one starts.
If a Pod's init container fails, the kubelet repeatedly restarts that init container until it succeeds. However, if the Pod has a `restartPolicy` of `Never`, and an init container fails during startup of that Pod, Kubernetes treats the overall Pod as failed.

> The status of the init containers is returned in `.status.initContainerStatuses` field.

### Differences from regular containers
Init containers support all the fields and features of app containers, including resource limits, volumes, and security settings. However, the resource requests and limits for an init container are handled differently.

Also, init containers do not support `lifecycle`, `livenessProbe`, `readinessProbe`, or `startupProbe` because they must run to completion before the Pod can be ready.

If you specify multiple init containers for a Pod, kubelet runs each init container sequentially. Each init container must succeed before the next can run. When all of the init containers have run to completion, kubelet initializes the application containers for the Pod and runs them as usual.

### Behaviour 

During Pod startup, the kubelet delays running init containers until the networking and storage are ready. Then the kubelet runs the Pod's init containers in the order they appear in the Pod's spec.

Each init container must exit successfully before the next container starts. If a container fails to start due to the runtime or exits with failure, it is retried according to the Pod restartPolicy. However, if the Pod restartPolicy is set to Always, the init containers use restartPolicy OnFailure.

A Pod cannot be Ready until all init containers have succeeded. The ports on an init container are not aggregated under a Service. A Pod that is initializing is in the Pending state but should have a condition Initialized set to false.

> If the Pod restarts, or is restarted, all init containers must execute again.

Init containers have all of the fields of an app container. However, Kubernetes prohibits readinessProbe from being used because init containers cannot define readiness distinct from completion. This is enforced during validation.

Use `activeDeadlineSeconds` on the Pod to prevent init containers from failing forever. The active deadline includes init containers. However it is recommended to use `activeDeadlineSeconds` only if teams deploy their application as a Job, because `activeDeadlineSeconds` has an effect even after initContainer finished. The Pod which is already running correctly would be killed by `activeDeadlineSeconds` if you set.
