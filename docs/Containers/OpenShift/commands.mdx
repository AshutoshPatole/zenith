1. To get node details

```bash
$ oc describe node $NODE_NAME
```

A Node's status contains the following information:

- Addresses (external ip, internal ip, hostname)
- Conditions (disk, memory, process id, status)
- Capacity and Allocatable (cpu & memory available and allocated)
- System Info

2. To mark a Node unschedulable, run:

```bash
$ oc cordon $NODE_NAME
```

3. Create the Deployment by running the following command:
```bash 
$ kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

:::info
you can also pass external yaml files like
```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/controllers/nginx-deployment.yaml
```
:::

4. Run this command to check if the Deployment was created.

```bash
$ kubectl get deployments

NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deploy   3/3     3            3           23d
```

5. To see the Deployment rollout status, run

```bash
$ kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deploy

Waiting for rollout to finish: 2 out of 3 new replicas have been updated...
deployment "nginx-deploy" successfully rolled out
```

6. To see the ReplicaSet (rs) created by the Deployment, run:

```bash
$ kubectl get rs

NAME                          DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
nginx-deploy-34729385   3         3         3       23d
```

7. To see the labels automatically generated for each Pod, run:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods --show-labels

NAME                                READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       LABELS
nginx-deploy-34729385-7ci7o   1/1       Running   0          18s       app=nginx,pod-template-hash=3123191453
nginx-deploy-34729385-kzszj   1/1       Running   0          18s       app=nginx,pod-template-hash=3123191453
nginx-deploy-34729385-qqcnn   1/1       Running   0          18s       app=nginx,pod-template-hash=3123191453

```
8. Get details of your Deployment:

```bash
kubectl describe deployments
```

9. You can scale a Deployment by using the following command:
```bash
kubectl scale deployment/nginx-deployment --replicas=10
```
