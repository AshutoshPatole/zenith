To create a SSH key in linux use this command

```sh
[thor@marvel-studios ~]$ ssh-keygen 
```
This will create a private key and public key inside `~/.ssh/` folder. 
By default the name of the key will be taken as `id_rsa`.

:::danger
Do not run this command if you have some keys already present inside .ssh/ folder.
Doing so will **override** the keys present in id_rsa file with the newly generated keys.
:::

```sh
[thor@marvel-studios ~]$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/fedora/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/fedora/.ssh/id_rsa
Your public key has been saved in /home/fedora/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:7UIivmQ/BnFwK41vnoMYocYDay9NRhMexXffdbKELiI fedora@LAPLR0F4Z7Y
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+
|    o.       .   |
|   o.... .  . o..|
|  . o=... .....o.|
|. .++ E .......  |
|oo..o=..S...     |
|o=.+..oo .       |
|o *o+= .. .      |
| ..=.o*  .       |
|  . ...o         |
+----[SHA256]-----+

```
In order to avoid this always use `-f` flag in the command as such:

```sh
[thor@marvel-studios ~]$ ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/newKey
```
This will create a new set of private and public keys called `newKey` and `newKey.pub` and not overriding other keys. You can also specify the algorithm type and length of the key using -t and -b flags

```sh
[thor@marvel-studios ~]$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/newPair
```

:::tip
Always specify the file name to avoid conflicts in keys.
