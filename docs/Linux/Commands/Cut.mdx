The cut command extracts portions of input lines and displays them on standard output. You can specify what to cut from input lines in several ways:

 - By Byte The -b list or --bytes=list option cuts the specified list of bytes from the input file. (The format of a list is described shortly.)

 - By Character The -c list or --characters=list option cuts the specified list of characters from the input file. In practice, this method and the by-byte method usually produce identical results. (If the input file uses a multi-byte encoding system, though, the results wonâ€™t be identical.)

 - By Field The -f list or --fields=list option cuts the specified list of fields from the input file. By default, a field is a tab-delimited section of a line, but you can change the delimiting character with the -d char, --delim=char, or --delimiter=char option, where char is the character you want to use to delimit fields. 

```bash
[thor@marvel-studios ~]$ ifconfig eth0
eth0 Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr 00:0C:76:96:A3:73
 inet addr:192.168.1.3 Bcast:192.168.1.255 Mask:255.255.255.0

Unfortunately, most of this information is extraneous for the desired purpose. The hardware address is the 6-byte hexadecimal number following HWaddr. To extract that data, you can combine grep with cut in a pipe:

```bash
[thor@marvel-studios ~]$ ifconfig eth0 | grep HWaddr | cut -d " " -f 11
```

will result 

```bash
00:0C:76:96:A3:73
```
